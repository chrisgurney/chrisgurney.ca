Once preparation is complete, what does the customer need to verify before proceeding with the job to ensure its successful execution?\n- Execute. Provide customers with real-time feedback or automatically correct execution problems.\n- Monitor. Assess whether the job is being successfully executed. Link monitoring with improved execution.\n- Modify. Make alterations to improve execution. Reduce the need to make alterations and the number needed.\n- Conclude. Finish the job or prepare to repeat it. Simplify the process of completing the job.\n \nb.) List Desired Outcomes under each (based on assumptions and understanding of domain to start, then fill out with research).\n \n\n- Desired outcomes typically state a direction of improvement (minimize or increase); contain a unit of measure (number, time, frequency, likelihood); and state what outcome is desired.\n- In most cases a dozen or so outcomes define success at each step.\n\n## Survey Outcomes\n\nSurvey Outcomes and prioritize based on results. (Which are important? Which are underserved by the market? Which are underperforming?)\n \n1. Prepare a survey instrument (questionnaire) that states all the job, outcome, and constraint statements that have been captured from customer interviews and from screening and profiling questions. \n1. Administer the survey to a statistically valid representation of the target population (often between 180 and 600 people). \n1. Ask the survey participants to rate the importance of all the jobs, outcomes, and constraints using a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 means critically important and 1 means not important at all. \n1. Ask the survey participants the degree to which they are satisfied with how the solutions they are using today address those jobs, outcomes, and constraints using a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 means totally satisfied and 1 means not satisfied at all. \n1. Enter the results into the opportunity algorithm to determine which jobs, outcomes, and constraints are underserved and overserved. Algorithm: Importance + max (Importance-Satisfaction,0) = Opportunity\n\n🛠 To facilitate this for in-person interviews, I use the Custom Fields Power Up and add a number field named “Votes” and increment for each time a desired outcome is brought up.\n \n## How Might We?\n\nChoose areas and start with _How Might We_ questions, to ideate.\n \n🛠 Trello card descriptions; or move to spreadsheet/Sketch to add other dimensions to map out the journey (e.g., emotion, context, etc.).\n \n The resulting structure looks something like this:\n \n- JTBD\n    - Job Step\n        - Desired Outcomes\n            - HMW\n        - Other dimensions (e.g., emotion, context, metrics, channels, touchpoints, timeline)\n \n\n# REFERENCES\n \n- Paul’s Notes on What Customers Want\n- http://strategyn.com/2013/10/14/tony-ulwick-presents-at-openco/\n- https://chrisgurney.ca/images/portfolio-fuzzies/journey-full.pdf\n\n# EXAMPLES\n \nFrom _What Customers Want_:\n \n- The interviewers focused the discussion on the activities associated with setting up and managing an insured’s account. They asked the agents what they were trying to achieve when obtaining quotes, preparing agreements, obtaining approvals, managing late paying accounts, posting payments, and reinstating policies. To obtain the agents’ desired outcomes, the interviewers instructed them to think through each of these activities during a typical day as they obtained quotes and offerings from different insurance companies. The interviewers asked the agents, “What makes one insurance company’s offering better or worse than another, and why? And what characteristics describe the ideal service offering?” By forcing this type of discussion, the interviewers were able to prompt the agents to reveal their desired outcomes.\n- They might say, “I do not like it when I have to spend half a day reinstating a policy that was inadvertently canceled by the insurer because they mailed the bill to the wrong address.” Upon hearing this statement an interviewer might say, “So this situation could be improved if you were able to minimize the time it takes to reinstate a policy that was inadvertently canceled by the insurer.” The agent might say, “Exactly”—in which case, the statement would be accepted as an outcome—or “No, I just wish the insurer would stop inadvertently canceling policies.” In this case, the interviewer would say, “So you want to minimize the likelihood that a policy is inadvertently canceled by the insurer,” and validate that the statement is correct."}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2019-05-02T01:13:09.098Z","limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"53f3fa0d0abc426ba1089ff7","avatarHash":"09e76226fbf07ac59e89ea1cf96f4d67","avatarUrl":"https://trello-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/09e76226fbf07ac59e89ea1cf96f4d67","fullName":"Chris

They asked the agents what they were trying to achieve when obtaining quotes, preparing agreements, obtaining approvals, managing late paying accounts, posting payments, and reinstating policies. To obtain the agents’ desired outcomes, the interviewers instructed them to think through each of these activities during a typical day as they obtained quotes and offerings from different insurance companies. The interviewers asked the agents, “What makes one insurance company’s offering better or worse than another, and why? And what characteristics describe the ideal service offering?” By forcing this type of discussion, the interviewers were able to prompt the agents to reveal their desired outcomes.\n- They might say, “I do not like it when I have to spend half a day reinstating a policy that was inadvertently canceled by the insurer because they mailed the bill to the wrong address.” Upon hearing this statement an interviewer might say, “So this situation could be improved if you were able to minimize the time it takes to reinstate a policy that was inadvertently canceled by the insurer.” The agent might say, “Exactly”—in which case, the statement would be accepted as an outcome—or “No, I just wish the insurer would stop inadvertently canceling policies.” In this case, the interviewer would say, “So you want to minimize the likelihood that a policy is inadvertently canceled by the insurer,” and validate that the statement is correct."},"old":{"desc":"(Ulwick)\n\n→ Survey for existing features\n\n(Summarize the Following)\n\n\n# The JTBD Approach\n \n## Identify what job the customer is trying to get done.\n \n- Expressed as a Job Story:\n    - When…(situation) I want… (motivation) so that… (expected outcome).\n- We think about the job from the customer’s perspective, not the company’s. \n- We think big; to encompass the entire job, not just a piece of it.\n- Functional jobs define the tasks people seek to accomplish, personal jobs explain the way people want to feel in a given circumstance, and social jobs clarify how people want to be perceived by others.\n\n🛠 Tooling: I use an empty Trello board.

Starting from the left: \n\n- \"TO FILE\" - For all the ideas that arise during this process, without worrying where to put them right away.\n- “JTBD\" - For the job itself. I also attach a sketch of the flow here.\n- Following that, each column represents each process step (“Discovery”, “Sign Up”, etc.). Use the Universal Job Map (below) if needed to determine ideas for each column.\n\n## For each Job...\n\na.) Determine stages (process steps) for the job. Can be based on the Universal Job Map (if helpful as a starting point):\n \n- Define. Customers determine their goals and plan resources. Simplify planning.\n- Locate. Customers gather items and information necessary to do the job.\n- Prepare. Setup the environment to do the job. Consider ways to make setup less difficult.\n- Confirm. Once preparation is complete, what does the customer need to verify before proceeding with the job to ensure its successful execution?\n- Execute. Provide customers with real-time feedback or automatically correct execution problems.\n- Monitor. Assess whether the job is being successfully executed. Link monitoring with improved execution.\n- Modify. Make alterations to improve execution. Reduce the need to make alterations and the number needed.\n- Conclude. Finish the job or prepare to repeat it. Simplify the process of completing the job.\n \nb.) List Desired Outcomes under each (based on assumptions and understanding of domain to start, then fill out with research).\n \n\n- Desired outcomes typically state a direction of improvement (minimize or increase); contain a unit of measure (number, time, frequency, likelihood); and state what outcome is desired.\n- In most cases a dozen or so outcomes define success at each step.\n\n## Survey Outcomes\n\nSurvey Outcomes and prioritize based on results. (Which are important? Which are underserved by the market? Which are underperforming?)\n \n1. Prepare a survey instrument (questionnaire) that states all the job, outcome, and constraint statements that have been captured from customer interviews and from screening and profiling questions. \n1. Administer the survey to a statistically valid representation of the target population (often between 180 and 600 people). \n1. Ask the survey participants to rate the importance of all the jobs, outcomes, and constraints using a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 means critically important and 1 means not important at all. \n1. Ask the survey participants the degree to which they are satisfied with how the solutions they are using today address those jobs, outcomes, and constraints using a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 means totally satisfied and 1 means not satisfied at all. \n1. Enter the results into the opportunity algorithm to determine which jobs, outcomes, and constraints are underserved and overserved. Algorithm: Importance + max (Importance-Satisfaction,0) = Opportunity\n\n🛠 To facilitate this for in-person interviews, I use the Custom Fields Power Up and add a number field named “Votes” and increment for each time a desired outcome is brought up.\n \n## How Might We?\n\nChoose areas and start with _How Might We_ questions, to ideate.\n \n🛠 Trello card descriptions; or move to spreadsheet/Sketch to add other dimensions to map out the journey (e.g., emotion, context, etc.).\n \n The resulting structure looks something like this:\n \n- JTBD\n    - Job Step\n        - Desired Outcomes\n            - HMW\n        - Other dimensions (e.g., emotion, context, metrics, channels, touchpoints, timeline)\n\n# References\n\n- Paul’s Notes on What Customers Want\n- http://strategyn.com/2013/10/14/tony-ulwick-presents-at-openco/\n- https://chrisgurney.ca/images/portfolio-fuzzies/journey-full.pdf\n\nExample from _What Customers Want_:\n \n> The interviewers focused the discussion on the activities associated with setting up and managing an insured’s account. They asked the agents what they were trying to achieve when obtaining quotes, preparing agreements, obtaining approvals, managing late paying accounts, posting payments, and reinstating policies. To obtain the agents’ desired outcomes, the interviewers instructed them to think through each of these activities during a typical day as they obtained quotes and offerings from different insurance companies. The interviewers asked the agents, “What makes one insurance company’s offering better or worse than another, and why?
