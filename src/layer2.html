              Voice &amp; Tone

              Practical - Clothing that makes sense, protects you from the elements, and doesn’t have any additional baggage; like a partner that has their tools with them at all times.

              Confident - If you could wear one of our jackets into a board meeting, you would; like an explorer, ready for whatever the world is going to throw at you.

              Optimistic - Brand imagery is aspirational; someone who sees the bright side of everything.

              Eccentric - Brand has a humorous personality, not your average clothing company; someone who’s a bit of an oddball.

              Playing off of the “urban jungle” theme, messaging can take on a humorous tone:

              Welcome
              Let’s suit up!

              Logo Use
              Variations


              Horizontal Brandmark with Wordmark
              Primary way to show the logo on web and other branded materials, and on large clothing labels.

              Blue Brandmark
              Use where space is constrained, and wordmark use is not possible.

              Dark Brandmark
              For light backgrounds where color and space is constrained, and wordmark use is not possible. Small clothing labels.

              Light Brandmark
              On dark backgrounds (which should be the primary color), as in the app icon, app splash screen, and website header/footer.

              App Icon
              Light brandmark on a subtle gradient blue, from the logo blue to light blue. For use on app and profile photo on social media (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook).


              Clear Space
              The brandmark needs to breathe. Leave 2 logo strokes around the logo available.

              Misuse Examples

              <i>Do not</i> enclose the logo in a shape. It needs to be free! App icons are the exception.
              <i>Do not</i> skew, bevel, fold, dimensionalize, stretch, add a drop shadow or otherwise alter the shape of the logo. There’s lots of other ways to use the logo; these aren’t the ways.
              <i>Do not</i> attempt to use the brandmark as the letter L. Just don’t even. We tried it and it doesn’t look good.
              <i>Do not</i> put the brandmark and wordmark in a vertical orientation, unless requested by your UX/UI design instructor.


              Colour Palette

              Layer 2’s bold blue is meant to inspire confidence, mixed with concrete greys to represent the urban environment that our customers live within.

              Primary Colors

              "Blue is commonly associated with trust, confidence, and sincerity; it is also used to represent calmness and responsibility." White, grey, and black shades are provided primarily for type. 

              Secondary Color

              Green was selected as a secondary to speak to our commitment to the environment, and to bring out the jungle theme.  

              This color should be used to highlight important features on a page, such as buttons, or for visual style elements, such as illustrations. They should be used sparingly and never draw the eye to more than one piece of information at a time.

              Typography

              Typefaces

              Source Sans Pro

              “Source® Sans Pro, Adobe's first open source typeface family, was designed by Paul D. Hunt. It is a sans serif typeface intended to work well in user interfaces.”

              0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

              Source Serif Pro

              “Source® Serif Pro is a set of OpenType fonts to complement the Source Sans Pro family.”

              Styles

              (Different sizes)

              Pattern

              The Layer 2 icon pattern background reinforces the logo and provides a textured background to use in apps and web properties. The pattern should not deviate from the one pictured here, and should be used in conjunction with the primary brand color.

              Components

              Icons

              Icons are 24x24 and generally lean towards a thick style. Icons are available in dark and light versions, depending on the background being used.

              UI Components

              Product Photo Card
              Form Field
              Form Field Error
              Modal
