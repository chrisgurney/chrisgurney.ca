              <h1>Design Challenge</h1>
              <p>
                How can we train ourselves to look for the positives in life?
              </p>       

              <h1>Design Solution</h1>
              <p>
                The practice of <strong>gratitude journaling</strong> <a href="https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/benefits-gratitude-research-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been shown</a> to have many positive benefits. It's as easy as writing down the things you are grateful for on a daily basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wanted to design a system that encourages people to get into the habit of gratitude journaling, and to share their gratitudes with others, using the technology they have at hand.
              </p>

              <h1>Solution Process</h1>
              <div class="popup-gallery mb-5">
                <a href="images/fuzzies/feed-evolution.png">
                  <img class="img-fluid" src="images/fuzzies/feed-evolution.png" alt="Fuzzies wireframe, medium, and full-fidelity mockup of the newsfeed." />

              </div>              
              <h6>Backstory</h6>
              <p>
                Ever since working at <a href="http://www.achievers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a company</a> where employee recognition was a common, everyday, and rewarding practice, I knew I wanted to bring that with me everywhere I went. 
              </p>
              <p>
                So initially for this project &mdash; my final project for the January 2018 Product &amp; UX Design class at <a href="https://bitmaker.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GA Bitmaker</a> &mdash; I had thought of building my own personal recognition solution... but that didn’t provide much of a design challenge for me, having lived in that world for many years.
              </p>

              <div class="mt-5 mb-4">
                <img class="img-fluid sr-image" src="images/fuzzies/persona-circles.png" alt="Person surrounded by circles." />
              </div>
              <p>
                I realized <strong>it begins with thanking ourselves</strong>: Finding the small, everyday things that we can be happy about; from our tiny accomplishments, to a tasty cup of coffee.  After we’ve started to appreciate the world around us and ourselves, we can <i>then</i> expand our gratitude to our family, friends, acquaintances... and idealistically everybody else we come across in our lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, <i>fuzzies</i> was born.
              </p>
              <h6>Ethnographic Research</h6>
              <p>
                I began by conducting interviews about gratitude. Over the course of these interviews, a few key insights emerged:
              </p>

              <h2>People have trouble coming up with gratitudes.</h2>
              <p>
                <a id="toggle-ethno1" data-toggle="collapse" href="#ethno1">Analysis <i class="toggle-ethno1 fa fa-angle-down"></i></a>
              </p>
              <div id="ethno1" class="collapse">
                <p>
                   I started each interview putting people on the spot to come up with things they’re grateful for. It’s challenging! <strong>What helps is a <i>prompt</i></strong>: some audio or visual cue to get the person to remember something.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My thought was, <strong>what information was already on the person's phone that could be used as prompts?</strong> I questioned people about how they used their phones, looking for what content (calendar entries, photos, songs played, conversations, stuff they read, etc.) we could use to trigger memories for journalling.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  I take photos of things that speak to me.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  For this iteration, I chose to <strong>focus on photos</strong>, to bring meaningful visuals into the app, as well as look at <strong>how to ask the user different questions</strong>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  For future versions:
                  <ul>
                    <li>people I talked to listen to music regularly, so it seemed like it would be a good option; and</li>
                    <li>most people use their calendar for things outside their routine, and mainly for work.</li>
                  </ul> 
                </p>
              </div>
              <h2>Developing the habit to journal is hard.</h2>
              <p>
                <a id="toggle-ethno2" data-toggle="collapse" href="#ethno2">Analysis <i class="toggle-ethno2 fa fa-angle-down"></i></a>
              </p>
              <div id="ethno2" class="collapse">              
                <p>
                  This wasn't surprising, as keeping any new habit is hard. As I knew notifications would be part of the solution, I asked about those:
                </p>           
                <blockquote>
                  Reminders shouldn’t go off at inopportune times.                
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  People who already practiced journaling did so at the beginning or end of the day. As a result, I chose to <strong>let the user set an ideal reminder time</strong>.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h2>Gratitude can be perceived negatively.</h2> 
              <p>
                <a id="toggle-ethno3" data-toggle="collapse" href="#ethno3">Analysis <i class="toggle-ethno3 fa fa-angle-down"></i></a>
              </p>
              <div id="ethno3" class="collapse">                           
                <blockquote>
                  Some people connect gratefulness to religion.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  This was something I hadn’t considered. In order to address the largest audience, I decided not to have monks or ties to religion as part of the app’s brand, in case this didn't connect with some of my potential users.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  Public gratitude on social media is not perceived to be genuine.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Try searching Twitter for the words “grateful” or “thankful”; the results can feel like they're bragging, relating to religion, or condescending.</p>
                <p>
                  A curated feed that is proprietary to the app, or a managed social feed, might work better (if needed for marketing, or as prompts within the app itself).
                </p>
              </div>

              <h6>Competitive Research</h6>
              <h2>What are similar products doing and what can I learn from them?</h2>

              <p>
                I made use of <strong>direct competitors</strong> (<i>My Gratitude Journal</i>, <i>Grateful</i>, <i>Uplifter</i>, <i>KYŌ</i>, pen and paper) for a number of days. I also looked at <strong>diaries</strong> (<i>Day One</i>, <i>Grid Diary</i>), apps that cater to <strong>building habits</strong> (<i>Productive</i>), and apps that provide <strong>writing prompts</strong> (<i>Werdsmith</i>, <i>Prompts</i>).
              </p>

                          Being able to do journal <strong>more than one gratitude at once</strong> was helpful, as thoughts flow when thinking about what to write. <strong>Text formatting options</strong> are nice, but I didn't think necessary for my MVP.

                          A couple apps allow you to <strong>customize a prompt question</strong>, which was useful. The ability to <strong>pull up photos <i>within</i> the editor</strong> was helpful; the weather, not so much.

              <h2>What opportunities exist in the market?</h2>

              <p>
                No apps provided <strong>prompts using other information from the phone</strong>, such as recently-played music (possible via the iOS Media Player framework, for example), or recent calendar entries.
              </p>

              <p>
                None of these apps think about <strong>life outside of the app</strong>: How can I easily record my gratitudes in other contexts (e.g., via conversational UIs)? 
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Sharing gratitudes</strong> wasn't something these apps focussed on, either, keeping journalling a private activity. While that may be appropriate for a diary, gratitudes definitely lend themselves to sharing, as evidenced by social media.
              </p>

                I found it helpful to look app's job-to-be-done in the context of Tony Ulwick’s <a href="https://jobs-to-be-done.com/mapping-the-job-to-be-done-45336427b3bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal job map</a>, having applied it successfully in previous projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using this lens <strong>raised a number of <i>"how might we"</i> questions</strong> that opened the implementation up to numerous solutions. You’ll see those on the <a href="images/fuzzies/journey-full.pdf" title="Fuzzies Journey Map PDF" target="_blank">user journey map</a>.

              </div>
              <p>
                My approach to onboarding the user was to <strong>get users to enter three gratitudes</strong>, and reward them for doing so; on an ongoing basis, three is recommended and rewarded, but not enforced. App permission prompts are spread out, and presented in the context in which they will aid the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                When mapped out, the onboarding flow looks rather long, but all my testing <strong>feedback indicated that it didn’t <i>feel</i> long</strong>.

              <p>
                As I created my wireframes, I really liked the concept of a <strong>chronological timeline</strong>, and centered my UI around that. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Each screen is really a snapshot of a moment in time in the conversation with the user. In hindsight, I think I would have done one continuous timeline to mock out the conversation to make sure it flowed, and <i>then</i> put them in screens.

                      Colors chosen were warm, bright, happy, and organic. I received overwhelming positive feedback about using orange as my primary color; and green paired well as a secondary color.

                      With a minimal amount of time to work on a brand, I kept the logo simple, by starting with my main font (Avenir) and adding the "fuzzy" i element.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                      The icon ultimately zeroed in on the fuzzy icon design, incorporating the rays in the background, and a high-contrast icon that worked well when placed on a screen with other app icons.

              </div>

              <p>
                The card design of the newsfeed evolved from something I didn't want to take a lot of vertical space (grouped by day), to one where each "fuzzy" became its own standalone object. I tested cards with and without photos, with the assumption that most users wouldn't add a photo.

                    <p>
                      I looked at Nir Eyal's <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/2012/03/how-to-manufacture-desire.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hook model</a> to build the habit of journaling.

                    <p>
                      After a notification (the <i>external trigger</i>) appears, the user is taken directly to the editor, with the keyboard displayed. Once the gratitude is entered, we display a random entry from another user (if they opted to share) as the <i>variable reward</i>.

                      To make it easy to make a fuzzy, one path might be to allow the user to take action from the reminder directly.

                    <p>
                      I was inspired by chat apps that allow you to do this, but had to research if it was available to others.

              <p>
                I wanted to see how we could be where the user is. During the day, that might be in a messaging tool such as Slack. To that end, I prototyped two commands, one for showing the latest entries and another for easily adding one:
