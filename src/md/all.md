The challenge was to double the usage of an existing, fictional guest book mobile app, to be used at small events such as baby showers. I mapped the journey of existing users, and decided to explore an opportunity in which an event volunteer could own the signing. Designed a brand and UI, centered around taking a recorded message or photo of guests.

Neighbor is a consumer billing platform that our team launched in three months, from concept to production. As head of design, I was responsible for the UX and UI for the entire platform, our bills, and email designs.

Once the first release was out the door, we then re-launched our website to sell what we had built, and to attract employees to the company. In so doing, I identified the need to refresh the brand, but only had a week to develop our new look.

The practice of gratitude journaling has been shown to have many positive benefits. It's as easy as writing down the things you are grateful for on a daily basis.

I wanted to design a system that encourages people to get into the habit of gratitude journaling, and to share their gratitudes with others, using the technology they have at hand.

# Achievers Product Management Initiatives

![Achievers logo](images/about/pm-achievers.jpg)

> - Employer: Achievers
> - My Role: Product Manager.

In addition to the API, I led the improvements on a number of features on the Achievers employee recognition and rewards platform.

## Login Flow Improvements

- Input from Support team on common challenges; password recovery was top reason members called in.
- Challenge: Also worked with Security team to ensure newer restrictions were taken into account: preventing brute-force attempts; modernizing CAPTCHA (accessible); increasing security questions; not letting the user know whether their email was on file or not;  
- ...all in the context of a white-labelled site. (This was always a challenge: What's Achievers and what's the client; ended up pushing out brand over time.)
- Clearer instructions for SSO (e.g., user attempts to sign in directly with network password, when SSO is enabled);
- "Your password is weaker than 40% of users" - social proof
- Researched spam; email improvements

## Transactional Email Improvements

> - Tags: Email

PM for improving the design of all our transactional emails.

- Inventoried all emails, their triggers, and CTAs.
- Journey map + JTBD for each email.
- Researched and scoped requirements for CASL compliance.

## Checkout Flow

- started as collection of "priorities" identified by ME: physical vs virtual, suggestion to notify users of orders
- challenged their assumptions
- checkout flow: used new employees  
- came down to adding an _Order_ button

## Administration System Improvements

- Worked closely with Support team, watched them use internal administration system in conjunction with Salesforce (for ticket tracking) to see what common workflows looked like.
- *Created shortcuts to speed up access and to populate key screens.*

## Other PM Work

- Holiday Emails
- HRIS Integration Improvements
- Issue Intake
- Focus Groups (PLM) and Product Advisory Council (PM)

Project Details

- After joining a company, I found out that the business' existing Intranet consisted of a handful of static web pages with aging links to outdated and non-existent resources.
- In an effort to resolve this, I took it upon myself to build a new Intranet from the ground up, with the goal of creating a tool by which employees could easily share useful information.
- Coincidentally, in my spare time I had been developing a web content management system called "g2", to power a community weblog used by friends. I quickly realized that g2 could be applied as an Intranet, as well. After performing some research and soliciting the needs of my users â€” my co-workers â€” I started to adapt the code base to fulfill the function of an Intranet.
- Following the release of a limited beta version in early 2005, I created a formal focus group consisting of stakeholders from several departments. Requirements gathered from that group were considered and folded into g2.
- At the end of 2005, the company's new Intranet was finally launched, was well-received, and continued to be used after my departure.

Highlights of the Intranet include: 

- News posts, for daily announcements.
- Articles, for lengthy how-to documents.
- Links, for providing references to internal and external resources.
- Discussion forums, where new, unread posts are highlighted.
- Photo gallery, for sharing pictures of employees and corporate events.
- Categorization, including support for placing items in multiple categories.
- Full-text search over all content.
- Navigation of items by category and by date.
- Local and LDAP user authentication, including support for Microsoft Active Directory.
- Search-able user directory, displaying local users and Microsoft Active Directory users.
- User profile pages that display a given user's contact information and content posted.
