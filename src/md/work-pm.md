Lead implementation of accessibility in our web platform, and raised awareness internally. This included:

- Interpreting WCAG levels, as it pertained to Achievers.
- Acquiring JAWS, and using tools where available for initial testing (WAVE, aChecker, Google).
- Finding an advocate in development who was interested in being the expert.
- Taking this developer to watch a user test further built empathy; they later did a [tech talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSkS9uI7Wqw){: target=_blank_} on the subject.

In addition to the API, I led improvement initiatives on a number of features on the Achievers employee recognition and rewards platform.

## Login Flow Improvements

- Problem: Interviewing the customer support team revealed login challenges our members commonly had; password recovery was top reason members called in. 
- Worked with Security team to ensure newer restrictions (partly due to ISO compliance) were taken into account: preventing brute-force attempts; modernizing CAPTCHA (making it accessible); increasing security questions; not letting the user know whether their email was on file or not... all in the context of a white-labelled platform.
- Solutions included: Clearer UI for login, and separation with SSO; password strength indicators and social proof (e.g., "Your password is weaker than 40% of users"); email improvements to try to avoid password emails from going to spam folders.

## Transactional Email Improvements

PM for improving the design of all our transactional emails.

- Inventoried all emails, their triggers, and CTAs.
- Created a journey map + performed a JTBD analysis for each email.
- Researched and scoped requirements for CASL compliance.
- Result included improving copy, CTAs, and implementing email subscription interface.

## Checkout Flow

- Improvements to the rewards catalogue checkout flow started as collection of "priorities" identified by our suppport team: Differences between physical (i.e., shipped) vs virtual (i.e., gift codes); notifications on order updates. I challenged their assumptions.
- Looked at data which revealed that users bookmarked the order status page, and didn't have a clear way back to that page otherwise.
- Mocked up changes to the checkout flow and tested it on new employees.

## Administration System Improvements

- Observed the support team using our internal administration system, to see what common workflows looked like.
- Solutions included creating shortcuts to our ticket tracking system, to speed up access and to populate key screens, shortening time on calls.

## Other PM Work

Other initiatives included:

- Holiday Emails - Our annually scheduled emails across all approved programs that encouraged redemptions.
- HRIS Integration Improvements - Executed requirements from our Professional Services team to improve the efficiency, integrity, and functionality behind data imports from HR systems.

Our latest product release was a big one for our company.

While providing an important, fresh set of features, it also visually marked a turning point in the design of our application. Compared to the previous version, the new release had a more modern look-and-feel to it and relied on updated technology, such as a brand new windowing framework.

As a result, it became apparent that we needed somebody to direct the redesign of all of the icons and graphics, as things would have looked very much out of place on top of our shiny new toolbars. That somebody had to identify all 250 icons, work with somebody to refresh what we had, and help to come up with design ideas for the new features we were adding.

As it turned out, that somebody was me.
