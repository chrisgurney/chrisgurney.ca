# Achievers Product Management Initiatives

![Achievers logo](images/about/pm-achievers.jpg)

> - Employer: Achievers
> - My Role: Product Manager.

In addition to the API, I led the improvements on a number of features on the Achievers employee recognition and rewards platform.

## Login Flow Improvements

- Input from Support team on common challenges; password recovery was top reason members called in.
- Challenge: Also worked with Security team to ensure newer restrictions were taken into account: preventing brute-force attempts; modernizing CAPTCHA (accessible); increasing security questions; not letting the user know whether their email was on file or not;  
- ...all in the context of a white-labelled site. (This was always a challenge: What's Achievers and what's the client; ended up pushing out brand over time.)
- Clearer instructions for SSO (e.g., user attempts to sign in directly with network password, when SSO is enabled);
- "Your password is weaker than 40% of users" - social proof
- Researched spam; email improvements

## Transactional Email Improvements

> - Tags: Email

PM for improving the design of all our transactional emails.

- Inventoried all emails, their triggers, and CTAs.
- Journey map + JTBD for each email.
- Researched and scoped requirements for CASL compliance.

## Checkout Flow

- started as collection of "priorities" identified by ME: physical vs virtual, suggestion to notify users of orders
- challenged their assumptions
- checkout flow: used new employees  
- came down to adding an _Order_ button

## Administration System Improvements

- Worked closely with Support team, watched them use internal administration system in conjunction with Salesforce (for ticket tracking) to see what common workflows looked like.
- *Created shortcuts to speed up access and to populate key screens.*

## Other PM Work

- Holiday Emails
- HRIS Integration Improvements
- Issue Intake
- Focus Groups (PLM) and Product Advisory Council (PM)

Project Details

- After joining a company, I found out that the business' existing Intranet consisted of a handful of static web pages with aging links to outdated and non-existent resources.
- In an effort to resolve this, I took it upon myself to build a new Intranet from the ground up, with the goal of creating a tool by which employees could easily share useful information.
- Coincidentally, in my spare time I had been developing a web content management system called "g2", to power a community weblog used by friends. I quickly realized that g2 could be applied as an Intranet, as well. After performing some research and soliciting the needs of my users — my co-workers — I started to adapt the code base to fulfill the function of an Intranet.
- Following the release of a limited beta version in early 2005, I created a formal focus group consisting of stakeholders from several departments. Requirements gathered from that group were considered and folded into g2.
- At the end of 2005, the company's new Intranet was finally launched, was well-received, and continued to be used after my departure.

Highlights of the Intranet include: 

- News posts, for daily announcements.
- Articles, for lengthy how-to documents.
- Links, for providing references to internal and external resources.
- Discussion forums, where new, unread posts are highlighted.
- Photo gallery, for sharing pictures of employees and corporate events.
- Categorization, including support for placing items in multiple categories.
- Full-text search over all content.
- Navigation of items by category and by date.
- Local and LDAP user authentication, including support for Microsoft Active Directory.
- Search-able user directory, displaying local users and Microsoft Active Directory users.
- User profile pages that display a given user's contact information and content posted.
