PM for implementing accessibility in our web platform, and to raise awareness internally.

In addition to the API, I led the improvements on a number of features on the Achievers employee recognition and rewards platform.

## Login Flow Improvements

- Input from Support team on common challenges; password recovery was top reason members called in.
- Challenge: Also worked with Security team to ensure newer restrictions were taken into account: preventing brute-force attempts; modernizing CAPTCHA (accessible); increasing security questions; not letting the user know whether their email was on file or not;  
- ...all in the context of a white-labelled site. (This was always a challenge: What's Achievers and what's the client; ended up pushing out brand over time.)
- Clearer instructions for SSO (e.g., user attempts to sign in directly with network password, when SSO is enabled);
- "Your password is weaker than 40% of users" - social proof
- Researched spam; email improvements

## Transactional Email Improvements

PM for improving the design of all our transactional emails.

- Inventoried all emails, their triggers, and CTAs.
- Journey map + JTBD for each email.
- Researched and scoped requirements for CASL compliance.

## Checkout Flow

- started as collection of "priorities" identified by ME: physical vs virtual, suggestion to notify users of orders
- challenged their assumptions
- checkout flow: used new employees  
- came down to adding an _Order_ button

## Administration System Improvements

- Worked closely with Support team, watched them use internal administration system in conjunction with Salesforce (for ticket tracking) to see what common workflows looked like.
- *Created shortcuts to speed up access and to populate key screens.*

## Other PM Work

- Holiday Emails
- HRIS Integration Improvements
- Issue Intake
- Focus Groups (PLM) and Product Advisory Council (PM)

While providing an important, fresh set of features, it also visually marked a turning point in the design of our application. Compared to the previous version, the new release had a more modern look-and-feel to it and relied on updated technology, such as a brand new windowing framework.

As a result, it became apparent that we needed somebody to direct the redesign of all of the icons and graphics, as things would have looked very much out of place on top of our shiny new toolbars. That somebody had to identify all 250 icons, work with somebody to refresh what we had, and help to come up with design ideas for the new features we were adding.

As it turned out, that somebody was me.
