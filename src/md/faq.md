###### My Background

# Tell me about your design background.

_TODO: More..._

I'm a UX designer who has toured the tech industry with a background in computer science, across a broad range of roles. Through product management, technical sales, marketing, services, and development, I've discovered my underlying passion is in the design and crafting of products that make peoples' lives better.

# Why did you switch to design? What do you enjoy about design?

_TODO: Edit this down._

- I get to be creative - I get to create something from nothing.
- It's more thankful - Perhaps a bit selfishly, there's an output that I can be recognized for, sooner. I had that at Achievers, but missed it at DevBBQ.
- The feedback loop feels shorter - I can present and incorporate feedback in shorter time periods. It's much easier to discuss a visual than it is written words.
- I get to learn - I get to read about design, psychology, and use visual tools that let me express myself.
- I already know stuff - I get to apply everything I've learned that's involved in building software, and look at it from a new perspective.
- I can get to code - To prototype, and (hopefully) to build my own app.
- I (may) not have to deal directly with clients, but rather with *users*.
- I'm hoping I won't wind up back in pure PM role again... but if I do -- say, there's no designer on the team, yet -- all of the above will make me a stronger, more design and problem-focussed PM-of-one.

# Tell me about your journey to design.

The way I like to summarize it is that it started with...

1. Implementation
	- QA and development roles, starting out with my CS degree -- who am I?
	- But the question I asked was "Why am I building what I'm building?"
* Selling
	- Services Consultant, Pre-Sales, Technical Marketing
	- (Didn't want to let go of being a developer.)
	- Key takeaway: Positioning; understanding customer needs.
* Translating (Bridging)
	- Training Requirements > Product Management
	- Business to tech, building bridges.
	- Key takeaway: What's the problem? JTBD
* Designing (Understanding)
	- Understanding the problem. Testing testing testing.
	- And now I'm a father: Watching my son learn, develop, and how he sees the world has given me a new perspective.

# How many years of design experience do you have?

- Neighbor: 10 months formally with the title of a designer, plus some at boot camps
- Experience in various PM roles either directly designing or working closely with design.
    - DevBBQ: Led design process from concept to launch or directly provided designs for several projects: CCMI (concussion tracker), Boon-Town (charity: responsive site), wayHire (recruiting), Paymi (financial rewards), railway (condo pre-purchase)
    - Achievers: Worked closely with design, or did my own where needed (e.g., API prototypes)
- (I fully admit I’m “new” to the role but I’ve decided it’s what I want to do with the rest of my career, and I want to work up the people leadership path.)
- Bitmaker: Fuzzies case study (+ Slack, notification)

###### Projects

# What’s the project you worked on that was your favorite? ...that you're most proud of? Why?

> This may get specific based on the requirements of the gig: What’s the research project that you’re most proud of? The design system rollout…? The healthcare system improvement…?

_TODO: Neighbor Deep-Dive_

> • Tell me what your process for the project was?
• Where did it deviate from what you prefer to do?
• How long did it take?
• Who else worked on it?
• What was challenging about it?
• How did you overcome those challenges?
• What would you do differently next time?

> • Draw the org chart and who worked on which pieces.
> • Draw the timeline for the project?
• Draw the early design ideas you had? (Especially the ones that turned out to need major revision. Why did they need it?)


# What’s a product that was taken to market and then iterated upon?

# Tell me about your experience designing web-based B2B apps.

- web: Neighbor, Achievers (features + Program Manual), DevBBQ (Therapia), Portfolio
  - projects involving: Bootstrap, vue.js, CodeIgniter
- responsive web - mobile considerations

# Tell me about your experience designing mobile apps.

- product owner on teams delivering native apps (React Native, Ionic)
  - e.g., Fanergy, Paymi

###### General

# How do you define the role of the Product Designer? Which parts of the product and process do you see as your responsibility, and which are not?

# What's your greatest strength as it relates to this position? Or, what can you do for us that another Product Designer can't?

# What is your favorite part of your current job?

# What would you change about your current job, if you could?

# Do you consider yourself technically inclined? What's the most technically-challenging project you've tackled?

# If you had to pick one of the following as your greatest strength, what would it be: UX, Visual Design or Front-End Implementation?

# Talk about a time when you couldn't deliver on something.

Accessibility at Achievers, took longer than expected, with friction:

- no knowledge internally
- limited resources: one developer
- solution: focussed in on core workflow (login, recognition, catalog)
- gained buy-in from Support team, took developer to user test, developer became advocate, did TechTalk

# Tell me about your current customers or clients. (How do you know they are your customers? How do you determine their needs? How you have met their needs? Who is your toughest customer and why?)

# What types of experiences have you had in talking with customers or clients? Tell me about a time when you had to communicate under difficult circumstances.

# Experience working at small companies, under ambiguous conditions?

- Have worked at several small companies; I prefer being able to wear many hats.

# How do you stay self-driven and motivated?

- Seeing my work come to life is motivation.
- I thrive at small companies
- work in one week sprints
- OKRs + quarterly objectives

# Experience working or managing remote?

- Have had management remote and developers remote
- Principles of remote work: Show deliverables often, be continually transparent, use tools that support this: Trello, JIRA (InVision, Gallery, etc.)

###### Process

# Tell me about your typical design process or the one you've seen that produced the best results.

_TODO: Summarize [My Design Process](process.html)._

# How do you build a deep understanding of your customers and their needs?

- conducted research, and established personas;
  - as a Designer, conducted user interviews and tests;
  - as a PM, conducted user interviews
  - have used data and analytics (SQL, GA, Salesforce) to derive behavior (examples?);
    - e.g., top module configuration profiles for Achievers;
    - order details page being bookmarked (direct traffic)
    - self-serve awards: used data to determine base options and defaults to show
    - ME: lots of anecdotal opinions
    - e.g., via FullStory, 
    - setup 
- user tested designs, recordings/QuickTime + Silverback;
- facilitated feedback process and identified patterns to address with design (examples?); 

# Tell me about a time you were surprised by user reactions during user research.

# Experience user testing and usability studies to direct product designs and priorities:

- Did guerrilla testing, used family, friends.
- Achievers Ops/Support:
	- looked for patterns across requests (e.g., several stemmed from not having an adequate testing environment)
	- involved during every sprint review
	- checkout flow: used new employees
- Used to having next to no budget, and limited time to get to market.
- More important to get designs out there and then iterate, survey, record analytics.
- Specific Examples:
  - Neighbor Bill:
  - Nintendo Switch Connect: 
- Checkout Flow
  - started as collection of "priorities" identified by ME: physical vs virtual, suggestion to notify users of orders
  - challenged their assumptions
  - came back to adding an Order button


# Tell me about a time your user testing changed your designs.

- (Used Neighbor bill testing, but it was generic)

# Experience gathering and managing feedback.

# Tell me about managing a roadmap?

- Long-term vision
- (Process: Story map)
