The challenge was to double the usage of an existing, fictional guest book mobile app, to be used at small events such as baby showers. I mapped the journey of existing users, and decided to explore an opportunity in which an event volunteer could own the signing. Designed a brand and UI, centered around taking a recorded message or photo of guests.

Neighbor is a consumer billing platform that our team launched in three months, from concept to production. As head of design, I was responsible for the UX and UI for the entire platform, our bills, and email designs.

Once the first release was out the door, we then re-launched our website to sell what we had built, and to attract employees to the company. In so doing, I identified the need to refresh the brand, but only had a week to develop our new look.

The practice of gratitude journaling has been shown to have many positive benefits. It's as easy as writing down the things you are grateful for on a daily basis.

I wanted to design a system that encourages people to get into the habit of gratitude journaling, and to share their gratitudes with others, using the technology they have at hand.

After joining a company, I found out that the business' existing Intranet consisted of a handful of static web pages with aging links to outdated and non-existent resources.

In an effort to resolve this, I took it upon myself to build a new Intranet from the ground up, with the goal of creating a tool by which employees could easily share useful information.
