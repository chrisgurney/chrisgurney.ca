I was given a challenge to double the usage of an existing, fictional guestbook mobile app, to be used at small events such as baby showers. 

I mapped the journey of existing users and decided to explore an opportunity in which an event volunteer could own the signing. I then designed a brand and UI, centered around taking a recorded message or photo of guests.

Once the first release of our Neighbor Billing platform was out the door, we then re-launched our website to sell what we had built, and to attract employees to the company. In so doing, I identified the need to refresh the brand, but gave ourselves a short timeframe to develop our new look.

The practice of gratitude journaling has been shown to have many positive benefits. It's as easy as writing down the things you are grateful for on a daily basis.

I wanted to design a system that encourages people to get into the habit of gratitude journaling, and to share their gratitudes with others, using the technology they have at hand.

As Product Manager for the Achievers API, I built prototypes to demonstrate present and future use cases using the API and our data. This helped our non-technical stakeholders visualize the potential value we could provide, and enabled new use cases for Sales.

Prototypes included:

- Experiments on TVs, bringing recognition and personalities into our physical spaces.
- Chrome Extension as a vehicle for change: Ability to recognize the author of a Confluence page, or JIRA ticket; overriding product styles.
- Outlook macro and Sharepoint widget: Recognition in the flow of work.

I worked with the founder of a cannabis grower to design a brand for his company. The goal was to take his name "Resinate" and create a trustworthy brand.

As part of this project I developed the logo, patterns, colors, and examples of its application to an investor pitch deck and to product packaging.

After joining a company, I found out that the business' existing Intranet consisted of a handful of static web pages with aging links to outdated and non-existent resources.

In an effort to resolve this, I took it upon myself to build a new Intranet from the ground up, with the goal of creating a tool by which employees could easily share useful information.
