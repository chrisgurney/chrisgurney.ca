<h6>My Background</h6>

<h1>Tell me about your design background.</h1>

<p><em>TODO: More...</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m a UX designer who has toured the tech industry with a background in computer science, across a broad range of roles. Through product management, technical sales, marketing, services, and development, I&#39;ve discovered my underlying passion is in the design and crafting of products that make peoples&#39; lives better.</p>

<h1>Why did you switch to design? What do you enjoy about design?</h1>

<p><em>TODO: Edit this down.</em></p>

<ul><li>I get to be creative - I get to create something from nothing.</li><li>It&#39;s more thankful - Perhaps a bit selfishly, there&#39;s an output that I can be recognized for, sooner. I had that at Achievers, but missed it at DevBBQ.</li><li>The feedback loop feels shorter - I can present and incorporate feedback in shorter time periods. It&#39;s much easier to discuss a visual than it is written words.</li><li>I get to learn - I get to read about design, psychology, and use visual tools that let me express myself.</li><li>I already know stuff - I get to apply everything I&#39;ve learned that&#39;s involved in building software, and look at it from a new perspective.</li><li>I can get to code - To prototype, and (hopefully) to build my own app.</li><li>I (may) not have to deal directly with clients, but rather with <em>users</em>.</li><li>I&#39;m hoping I won&#39;t wind up back in pure PM role again... but if I do -- say, there&#39;s no designer on the team, yet -- all of the above will make me a stronger, more design and problem-focussed PM-of-one.</li></ul>

<h1>Tell me about your journey to design.</h1>

<p>The way I like to summarize it is that it started with...</p>

<ol><li>Implementation<ul><li>QA and development roles, starting out with my CS degree -- who am I?</li><li>But the question I asked was &quot;Why am I building what I&#39;m building?&quot;</li></ul></li><li>Selling<ul><li>Services Consultant, Pre-Sales, Technical Marketing</li><li>(Didn&#39;t want to let go of being a developer.)</li><li>Key takeaway: Positioning; understanding customer needs.</li></ul></li><li>Translating (Bridging)<ul><li>Training Requirements &gt; Product Management</li><li>Business to tech, building bridges.</li><li>Key takeaway: What&#39;s the problem? JTBD</li></ul></li><li>Designing (Understanding)<ul><li>Understanding the problem. Testing testing testing.</li><li>And now I&#39;m a father: Watching my son learn, develop, and how he sees the world has given me a new perspective.</li></ul></li></ol>

<h1>How many years of design experience do you have?</h1>

<ul><li>Neighbor: 10 months formally with the title of a designer, plus some at boot camps</li><li>Experience in various PM roles either directly designing or working closely with design.<ul><li>DevBBQ: Led design process from concept to launch or directly provided designs for several projects: CCMI (concussion tracker), Boon-Town (charity: responsive site), wayHire (recruiting), Paymi (financial rewards), railway (condo pre-purchase)</li><li>Achievers: Worked closely with design, or did my own where needed (e.g., API prototypes)</li></ul></li><li>(I fully admit I’m “new” to the role but I’ve decided it’s what I want to do with the rest of my career, and I want to work up the people leadership path.)</li><li>Bitmaker: Fuzzies case study (+ Slack, notification)</li></ul>
